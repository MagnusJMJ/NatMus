# Git Helper
This is a bash script I wrote in my spare time to ease the workflow of using Git
for my assignments. My own programming course offered a very poor introduction to
Git, and I found it tedious to use the terminal so often. This script was my first
foray into coding that was completely outside my course curriculum, and it was
also the first time I observed a problem and was able to program my way out of it.
